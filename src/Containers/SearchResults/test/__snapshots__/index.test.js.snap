Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent of the type of applied secretory fuel (glucose, methyl-pyruvate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate). In addition, single cells respond with the same pattern when repeatedly stimulated, regardless of the type of stimulatory fuel. Presence of substimulatory glucose is not necessary to obtain an oscillatory responses to methyl-pyruvate or alpha-ketoisocaproate. Glucose-6-phosphate, as a measure of glycolytic flux, is not detectable under these conditions. These data suggest that multiple systems, rather than a single enzyme component, can contribute to the beta-cell oscillatory behavior. Prolonged exposure to high levels of palmitate impaired oscillatory regularity in the individual beta-cells. This supports the hypothesis that a high-fat environment might contribute to loss of regular oscillatory pattern in diabetic subjects, acting, at least in part, at the level of the single beta-cel",

              "description": "The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made through studying heart development in avian embryos, particularly the chicken. The major advantage of chick embryos is their accessibility for surgical manipulations and functional interference approaches, both gain- and loss-of-function. In addition to experiments performed in ovo, the dissection of tissues for ex vivo culture, genomic or biochemical approaches, is straightforward. Furthermore, embryos can be cultured for time-lapse imaging, which enables tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and detailed analyses of tissue morphogenesis. Owing to these features, investigations in chick embryos have led to important discoveries, often complementing genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish. As well as including some historical aspects, we cover here some of the crucial advances made in understanding of early heart development using the chicken model",

The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\\\ud
        management by practice nurses for people with CHD and depression. We followed 803 people with CHD for up to 3 years, assessing them for depression, chest pain and\\\\ud
        worsening of heart disease, and also measured care costs. We asked patients, GPs and nurses how people with CHD and depression should be treated. From this, we developed care designed for each person called ‘personalised care’ (PC). We tested it in 41 people (while 40 people received their usual care from GPs)\\\\ud
        with chest pain and depression, to assess how acceptable it is, whether or not it helps and what the costs would be. PC was acceptable to people, and those who received it reported less chest pain 6 and 12 months later. Costs were lower following PC but the difference was not statistically significant. Just under half of those with CHD had chest pain. Depression was frequent, but anxiety was more\\\\ud
        common and increased the chances of both heart attacks and death. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the links between anxiety, chest pain and heart\\\\ud

Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: Published and unpublished literature from: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and clinical trial registers. Search to 22nd November 2014. Cohort, case-control, randomised and non-randomised controlled trial papers reporting the prevalence of CVD in osteoarthritis were included. Results: Fifteen studies with 32,278,744 individuals were eligible. Pooled prevalence for overall CVD pathology in people with osteoarthritis was 38.4% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 37.2% to 39.6%). Individuals with osteoarthritis were almost three times as likely to have heart failure (Relative Risk (RR): 2.80; 95% CI: 2.25 to 3.49) or ischaemic heart disease (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.69) compared to matched non-osteoarthritis cohorts. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction or stroke. There was a three-fold decrease in the risk of experiencing a transient ischaemic attack in the osteoarthritis cohort compared to the non-osteoarthritis group. Conclusions: Prevalence of CVD in patients with OA is significant. There was an observed increased risk of incident heart failure and ischaemic heart disease in people with OA compared to matched controls. However the relationship between OA and CVD is not straight-forward and there is a need to better understand the potential common pathways linking pathophysiological mechanisms",

Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion in STEMI patients. We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results: 13 RCTs (4273 STEMI patients) were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.25–0.78], P = 0.005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow<3 postreperfusion 0.68 [95% CI 0.47–0.99], P = 0.04). There was no difference in heart failure incidence in the intravenous adenosine group but most RCTs in this subgroup were from the thrombolysis era. There was no difference in non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality in both subgroups. Conclusion: We find evidence of improved clinical outcome in terms of less heart failure in STEMI patients administered intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion. This finding will need to be confirmed in a large adequately powered prospective RCT",

              "description": "Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm now exists for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but there have been very few notable developments in recent years. HF remains a significant health concern with an increasing incidence as the population ages. We may indeed be entering the surgical era for HF treatment, but these therapies remain expensive and inaccessible to many. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents are slowly emerging, many targeting alternative therapeutic pathways, but with mixed results. Metabolic modulation and manipulation of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway have shown promise and could provide the answers to fill the therapeutic gap between medical interventions and surgery, but further definitive trials are warranted. We review the significant evidence base behind the current medical treatments for HFrEF, the physiology of metabolic impairment in HF, and discuss two promising novel agents, perhexiline and nitrite",

              "description": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices.

At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable prognosis model of the motor's remaining life",

                              We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                              conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                              conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                              see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                              simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                              which may be of independent interest.Comment: ...

                              Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                              The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                              Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                    <p>
                              Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                              The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                                conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                                see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                                simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                                Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                <p>
                                Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                  Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                  The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                  Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                  Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                  Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times.

                  The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                    We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                                    see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                                    simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                    We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                                    see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                                    simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                                    which may be of independent interest.Comment: ...

                                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                    We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                    see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                    simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                    which may be of independent interest.Comment: ...

                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent of the type of applied secretory fuel (glucose, methyl-pyruvate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate). In addition, single cells respond with the same pattern when repeatedly stimulated, regardless of the type of stimulatory fuel. Presence of substimulatory glucose is not necessary to obtain an oscillatory responses to methyl-pyruvate or alpha-ketoisocaproate. Glucose-6-phosphate, as a measure of glycolytic flux, is not detectable under these conditions. These data suggest that multiple systems, rather than a single enzyme component, can contribute to the beta-cell oscillatory behavior. Prolonged exposure to high levels of palmitate impaired oscillatory regularity in the individual beta-cells. This supports the hypothesis that a high-fat environment might contribute to loss of regular oscillatory pattern in diabetic subjects, acting, at least in part, at the level of the single beta-cel",

              "description": "The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made through studying heart development in avian embryos, particularly the chicken. The major advantage of chick embryos is their accessibility for surgical manipulations and functional interference approaches, both gain- and loss-of-function. In addition to experiments performed in ovo, the dissection of tissues for ex vivo culture, genomic or biochemical approaches, is straightforward. Furthermore, embryos can be cultured for time-lapse imaging, which enables tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and detailed analyses of tissue morphogenesis. Owing to these features, investigations in chick embryos have led to important discoveries, often complementing genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish. As well as including some historical aspects, we cover here some of the crucial advances made in understanding of early heart development using the chicken model",

The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\\\ud
        management by practice nurses for people with CHD and depression. We followed 803 people with CHD for up to 3 years, assessing them for depression, chest pain and\\\\ud
        worsening of heart disease, and also measured care costs. We asked patients, GPs and nurses how people with CHD and depression should be treated. From this, we developed care designed for each person called ‘personalised care’ (PC). We tested it in 41 people (while 40 people received their usual care from GPs)\\\\ud
        with chest pain and depression, to assess how acceptable it is, whether or not it helps and what the costs would be. PC was acceptable to people, and those who received it reported less chest pain 6 and 12 months later. Costs were lower following PC but the difference was not statistically significant. Just under half of those with CHD had chest pain. Depression was frequent, but anxiety was more\\\\ud
        common and increased the chances of both heart attacks and death. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the links between anxiety, chest pain and heart\\\\ud

              "description": "Background: To examine for a possible relationship between osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: Published and unpublished literature from: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and clinical trial registers. Search to 22nd November 2014. Cohort, case-control, randomised and non-randomised controlled trial papers reporting the prevalence of CVD in osteoarthritis were included. Results: Fifteen studies with 32,278,744 individuals were eligible. Pooled prevalence for overall CVD pathology in people with osteoarthritis was 38.4% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 37.2% to 39.6%). Individuals with osteoarthritis were almost three times as likely to have heart failure (Relative Risk (RR): 2.80; 95% CI: 2.25 to 3.49) or ischaemic heart disease (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.69) compared to matched non-osteoarthritis cohorts. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction or stroke. There was a three-fold decrease in the risk of experiencing a transient ischaemic attack in the osteoarthritis cohort compared to the non-osteoarthritis group. Conclusions: Prevalence of CVD in patients with OA is significant. There was an observed increased risk of incident heart failure and ischaemic heart disease in people with OA compared to matched controls. However the relationship between OA and CVD is not straight-forward and there is a need to better understand the potential common pathways linking pathophysiological mechanisms",

Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion in STEMI patients. We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results: 13 RCTs (4273 STEMI patients) were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.25–0.78], P = 0.005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow<3 postreperfusion 0.68 [95% CI 0.47–0.99], P = 0.04). There was no difference in heart failure incidence in the intravenous adenosine group but most RCTs in this subgroup were from the thrombolysis era. There was no difference in non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality in both subgroups. Conclusion: We find evidence of improved clinical outcome in terms of less heart failure in STEMI patients administered intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion. This finding will need to be confirmed in a large adequately powered prospective RCT",

              "description": "Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm now exists for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but there have been very few notable developments in recent years. HF remains a significant health concern with an increasing incidence as the population ages. We may indeed be entering the surgical era for HF treatment, but these therapies remain expensive and inaccessible to many. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents are slowly emerging, many targeting alternative therapeutic pathways, but with mixed results. Metabolic modulation and manipulation of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway have shown promise and could provide the answers to fill the therapeutic gap between medical interventions and surgery, but further definitive trials are warranted. We review the significant evidence base behind the current medical treatments for HFrEF, the physiology of metabolic impairment in HF, and discuss two promising novel agents, perhexiline and nitrite",

              "description": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice",

At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable prognosis model of the motor's remaining life",

                              We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                              conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                              conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                              see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                              simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                              Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                              The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human.

                              Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks.

                              Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                              Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                              The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                                conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also

                                Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks. The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\ud

                                Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                  We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                  conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                  conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                  see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with

                  Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                  The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                  Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                  Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                  Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                  The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                    We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                                    see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                                    simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also

                                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

                                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                    We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                    see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                    simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on
                    the index of accessibility of various constructions on accessible categories,
                    which may be of independent interest.Comment: ...

                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human.

                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

              "description": "Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent of the type of applied secretory fuel (glucose, methyl-pyruvate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate). In addition, single cells respond with the same pattern when repeatedly stimulated, regardless of the type of stimulatory fuel. Presence of substimulatory glucose is not necessary to obtain an oscillatory responses to methyl-pyruvate or alpha-ketoisocaproate. Glucose-6-phosphate, as a measure of glycolytic flux, is not detectable under these conditions. These data suggest that multiple systems, rather than a single enzyme component, can contribute to the beta-cell oscillatory behavior. Prolonged exposure to high levels of palmitate impaired oscillatory regularity in the individual beta-cells. This supports the hypothesis that a high-fat environment might contribute to loss of regular oscillatory pattern in diabetic subjects, acting, at least in part, at the level of the single beta-cel",

              "description": "The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made through studying heart development in avian embryos, particularly the chicken. The major advantage of chick embryos is their accessibility for surgical manipulations and functional interference approaches, both gain- and loss-of-function. In addition to experiments performed in ovo, the dissection of tissues for ex vivo culture, genomic or biochemical approaches, is straightforward. Furthermore, embryos can be cultured for time-lapse imaging, which enables tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and detailed analyses of tissue morphogenesis. Owing to these features, investigations in chick embryos have led to important discoveries, often complementing genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish. As well as including some historical aspects, we cover here some of the crucial advances made in understanding of early heart development using the chicken model",

From this, we developed care designed for each person called ‘personalised care’ (PC). We tested it in 41 people (while 40 people received their usual care from GPs)\\\\ud
        with chest pain and depression, to assess how acceptable it is, whether or not it helps and what the costs would be. PC was acceptable to people, and those who received it reported less chest pain 6 and 12 months later. Costs were lower following PC but the difference was not statistically significant. Just under half of those with CHD had chest pain. Depression was frequent, but anxiety was more\\\\ud
        common and increased the chances of both heart attacks and death. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the links between anxiety, chest pain and heart\\\\ud

Individuals with osteoarthritis were almost three times as likely to have heart failure (Relative Risk (RR): 2.80; 95% CI: 2.25 to 3.49) or ischaemic heart disease (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.69) compared to matched non-osteoarthritis cohorts. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction or stroke. There was a three-fold decrease in the risk of experiencing a transient ischaemic attack in the osteoarthritis cohort compared to the non-osteoarthritis group. Conclusions: Prevalence of CVD in patients with OA is significant. There was an observed increased risk of incident heart failure and ischaemic heart disease in people with OA compared to matched controls. However the relationship between OA and CVD is not straight-forward and there is a need to better understand the potential common pathways linking pathophysiological mechanisms",

Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion in STEMI patients. We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results: 13 RCTs (4273 STEMI patients) were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.25–0.78], P = 0.005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow<3 postreperfusion 0.68 [95% CI 0.47–0.99], P = 0.04). There was no difference in heart failure incidence in the intravenous adenosine group but most RCTs in this subgroup were from the thrombolysis era. There was no difference in non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality in both subgroups. Conclusion: We find evidence of improved clinical outcome in terms of less heart failure in STEMI patients administered intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion. This finding will need to be confirmed in a large adequately powered prospective RCT",

              "description": "Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm now exists for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but there have been very few notable developments in recent years. HF remains a significant health concern with an increasing incidence as the population ages. We may indeed be entering the surgical era for HF treatment, but these therapies remain expensive and inaccessible to many. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents are slowly emerging, many targeting alternative therapeutic pathways, but with mixed results. Metabolic modulation and manipulation of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway have shown promise and could provide the answers to fill the therapeutic gap between medical interventions and surgery, but further definitive trials are warranted. We review the significant evidence base behind the current medical treatments for HFrEF, the physiology of metabolic impairment in HF, and discuss two promising novel agents, perhexiline and nitrite",

              "description": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice",

        conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and

        simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on
        the index of accessibility of various constructions on accessible categories,

              "description": "Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent of the type of applied secretory fuel (glucose, methyl-pyruvate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate). In addition, single cells respond with the same pattern when repeatedly stimulated, regardless of the type of stimulatory fuel. Presence of substimulatory glucose is not necessary to obtain an oscillatory responses to methyl-pyruvate or alpha-ketoisocaproate. Glucose-6-phosphate, as a measure of glycolytic flux, is not detectable under these conditions. These data suggest that multiple systems, rather than a single enzyme component, can contribute to the beta-cell oscillatory behavior. Prolonged exposure to high levels of palmitate impaired oscillatory regularity in the individual beta-cells. This supports the hypothesis that a high-fat environment might contribute to loss of regular oscillatory pattern in diabetic subjects, acting, at least in part, at the level of the single beta-cel",

              "description": "The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made through studying heart development in avian embryos, particularly the chicken. The major advantage of chick embryos is their accessibility for surgical manipulations and functional interference approaches, both gain- and loss-of-function. In addition to experiments performed in ovo, the dissection of tissues for ex vivo culture, genomic or biochemical approaches, is straightforward. Furthermore, embryos can be cultured for time-lapse imaging, which enables tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and detailed analyses of tissue morphogenesis. Owing to these features, investigations in chick embryos have led to important discoveries, often complementing genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish. As well as including some historical aspects, we cover here some of the crucial advances made in understanding of early heart development using the chicken model",

              "description": "Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks. The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\\\ud
        management by practice nurses for people with CHD and depression. We followed 803 people with CHD for up to 3 years, assessing them for depression, chest pain and\\\\ud
        worsening of heart disease, and also measured care costs. We asked patients, GPs and nurses how people with CHD and depression should be treated. From this, we developed care designed for each person called ‘personalised care’ (PC). We tested it in 41 people (while 40 people received their usual care from GPs)\\\\ud
        with chest pain and depression, to assess how acceptable it is, whether or not it helps and what the costs would be. PC was acceptable to people, and those who received it reported less chest pain 6 and 12 months later. Costs were lower following PC but the difference was not statistically significant. Just under half of those with CHD had chest pain. Depression was frequent, but anxiety was more\\\\ud
        common and increased the chances of both heart attacks and death. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the links between anxiety, chest pain and heart\\\\ud
        disease, and to further develop our promising findings that PC can be helpful in reducing chest pain in\\\\ud

              "description": "Background: To examine for a possible relationship between osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: Published and unpublished literature from: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and clinical trial registers. Search to 22nd November 2014. Cohort, case-control, randomised and non-randomised controlled trial papers reporting the prevalence of CVD in osteoarthritis were included. Results: Fifteen studies with 32,278,744 individuals were eligible. Pooled prevalence for overall CVD pathology in people with osteoarthritis was 38.4% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 37.2% to 39.6%). Individuals with osteoarthritis were almost three times as likely to have heart failure (Relative Risk (RR): 2.80; 95% CI: 2.25 to 3.49) or ischaemic heart disease (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.69) compared to matched non-osteoarthritis cohorts. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction or stroke. There was a three-fold decrease in the risk of experiencing a transient ischaemic attack in the osteoarthritis cohort compared to the non-osteoarthritis group. Conclusions: Prevalence of CVD in patients with OA is significant. There was an observed increased risk of incident heart failure and ischaemic heart disease in people with OA compared to matched controls. However the relationship between OA and CVD is not straight-forward and there is a need to better understand the potential common pathways linking pathophysiological mechanisms",

              "description": "Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion in STEMI patients. We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results: 13 RCTs (4273 STEMI patients) were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.25–0.78], P = 0.005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow<3 postreperfusion 0.68 [95% CI 0.47–0.99], P = 0.04). There was no difference in heart failure incidence in the intravenous adenosine group but most RCTs in this subgroup were from the thrombolysis era. There was no difference in non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality in both subgroups. Conclusion: We find evidence of improved clinical outcome in terms of less heart failure in STEMI patients administered intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion. This finding will need to be confirmed in a large adequately powered prospective RCT",

              "description": "Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm now exists for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but there have been very few notable developments in recent years. HF remains a significant health concern with an increasing incidence as the population ages. We may indeed be entering the surgical era for HF treatment, but these therapies remain expensive and inaccessible to many. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents are slowly emerging, many targeting alternative therapeutic pathways, but with mixed results. Metabolic modulation and manipulation of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway have shown promise and could provide the answers to fill the therapeutic gap between medical interventions and surgery, but further definitive trials are warranted. We review the significant evidence base behind the current medical treatments for HFrEF, the physiology of metabolic impairment in HF, and discuss two promising novel agents, perhexiline and nitrite",

              "description": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice",

              "description": "Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent of the type of applied secretory fuel (glucose, methyl-pyruvate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate). In addition, single cells respond with the same pattern when repeatedly stimulated, regardless of the type of stimulatory fuel. Presence of substimulatory glucose is not necessary to obtain an oscillatory responses to methyl-pyruvate or alpha-ketoisocaproate. Glucose-6-phosphate, as a measure of glycolytic flux, is not detectable under these conditions. These data suggest that multiple systems, rather than a single enzyme component, can contribute to the beta-cell oscillatory behavior. Prolonged exposure to high levels of palmitate impaired oscillatory regularity in the individual beta-cells. This supports the hypothesis that a high-fat environment might contribute to loss of regular oscillatory pattern in diabetic subjects, acting, at least in part, at the level of the single beta-cel",

              "description": "The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made through studying heart development in avian embryos, particularly the chicken. The major advantage of chick embryos is their accessibility for surgical manipulations and functional interference approaches, both gain- and loss-of-function. In addition to experiments performed in ovo, the dissection of tissues for ex vivo culture, genomic or biochemical approaches, is straightforward. Furthermore, embryos can be cultured for time-lapse imaging, which enables tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and detailed analyses of tissue morphogenesis. Owing to these features, investigations in chick embryos have led to important discoveries, often complementing genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish.

              "description": "Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks. The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\\\ud
        management by practice nurses for people with CHD and depression. We followed 803 people with CHD for up to 3 years, assessing them for depression, chest pain and\\\\ud
        worsening of heart disease, and also measured care costs. We asked patients, GPs and nurses how people with CHD and depression should be treated. From this, we developed care designed for each person called ‘personalised care’ (PC). We tested it in 41 people (while 40 people received their usual care from GPs)\\\\ud
        with chest pain and depression, to assess how acceptable it is, whether or not it helps and what the costs would be. PC was acceptable to people, and those who received it reported less chest pain 6 and 12 months later. Costs were lower following PC but the difference was not statistically significant. Just under half of those with CHD had chest pain. Depression was frequent, but anxiety was more\\\\ud
        common and increased the chances of both heart attacks and death. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the links between anxiety, chest pain and heart\\\\ud
        disease, and to further develop our promising findings that PC can be helpful in reducing chest pain in\\\\ud

              "description": "Background: To examine for a possible relationship between osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: Published and unpublished literature from: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and clinical trial registers. Search to 22nd November 2014. Cohort, case-control, randomised and non-randomised controlled trial papers reporting the prevalence of CVD in osteoarthritis were included. Results: Fifteen studies with 32,278,744 individuals were eligible. Pooled prevalence for overall CVD pathology in people with osteoarthritis was 38.4% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 37.2% to 39.6%). Individuals with osteoarthritis were almost three times as likely to have heart failure (Relative Risk (RR): 2.80; 95% CI: 2.25 to 3.49) or ischaemic heart disease (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.69) compared to matched non-osteoarthritis cohorts. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction or stroke. There was a three-fold decrease in the risk of experiencing a transient ischaemic attack in the osteoarthritis cohort compared to the non-osteoarthritis group. Conclusions: Prevalence of CVD in patients with OA is significant. There was an observed increased risk of incident heart failure and ischaemic heart disease in people with OA compared to matched controls. However the relationship between OA and CVD is not straight-forward and there is a need to better understand the potential common pathways linking pathophysiological mechanisms",

Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion in STEMI patients. We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results: 13 RCTs (4273 STEMI patients) were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.25–0.78], P = 0.005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow<3 postreperfusion 0.68 [95% CI 0.47–0.99], P = 0.04). There was no difference in heart failure incidence in the intravenous adenosine group but most RCTs in this subgroup were from the thrombolysis era. There was no difference in non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality in both subgroups. Conclusion: We find evidence of improved clinical outcome in terms of less heart failure in STEMI patients administered intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion. This finding will need to be confirmed in a large adequately powered prospective RCT",

              "description": "Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm now exists for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but there have been very few notable developments in recent years. HF remains a significant health concern with an increasing incidence as the population ages. We may indeed be entering the surgical era for HF treatment, but these therapies remain expensive and inaccessible to many. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents are slowly emerging, many targeting alternative therapeutic pathways, but with mixed results. Metabolic modulation and manipulation of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway have shown promise and could provide the answers to fill the therapeutic gap between medical interventions and surgery, but further definitive trials are warranted. We review the significant evidence base behind the current medical treatments for HFrEF, the physiology of metabolic impairment in HF, and discuss two promising novel agents, perhexiline and nitrite",

              "description": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice",

At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable prognosis model of the motor's remaining life",

                              We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                              conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                              conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                              see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with

                              Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                              The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                              Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                              Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                              The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and

                                Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                <p>
                                Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                  Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                  The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human.

                  Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks. The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\ud
                  management by practice nurses for people with CHD and depression. We followed 803 people with CHD for up t...

                  Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                  Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                <p>
                  Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                  The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and

                                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

                                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                                    We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size
                                    conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
                                    conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also
                                    see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with
                                    simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on

                                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                                    Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks. The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\ud

                                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...

                    Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent...

                    The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made t...

                    Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion ...

                    Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm no...

                    Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitat...

                    The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable...
