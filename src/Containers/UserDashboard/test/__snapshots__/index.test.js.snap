        The heart of a combinatorial model category
        Zhen Lin Low
        27 February 2014
        Abstract
        We show that small model categories satisfying certain size condi-
        tions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and
        conversely, that every combinatorial model category arises in this way.
        We also show that these constructions preserve right properness and
        compatibility with simplicial enrichment.
        Introduction
        Category-theoretic homotopy theory has seen a boom in recent decades. One
        development was the introduction of the notion of ‘combinatorial model cat-
        egories’ by Smith [1998]. These correspond to what Lurie [HTT] calls ‘present-
        able ∞-categories’ and are therefore a homotopy-theoretic generalisation of
        the locally presentable categories of Gabriel and Ulmer [1971]. The classiﬁc-
        ation of locally κ-presentable categories says that each one is equivalent to
        the free κ-ind-completion of a κ-cocomplete small category, and Lurie proved
        the analogous proposition for presentable ∞-categories, so it should at least
        seem plausible that every combinatorial model category is generated by a small
        model category in an appropriate sense.
        Indeed, the work of Beke [2000] suggests that more should be true. As
        stated in the abstract of the cited paper,
        If a Quillen model category can be speciﬁed using a certain logical
        syntax (intuitively, ‘is algebraic/combinatorial enough’), so that it
        can be deﬁned in any category of sheaves, then the satisfaction of
        Quillen’s axioms over any site is a purely formal consequence of
        their being satisﬁed over the category of sets.

        The heart of a combinatorial model category
        and similarly, we can show that the question of whether a set of generating
        coﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations in a locally presentable category really do
        generate a combinatorial model category depends only on an essentially small
        full subcategory of small objects. More precisely:
        Theorem. Let M be a locally presentable category, and let I and I ′ be sub-
        sets of mor C. Suppose κ and λ are regular cardinals satisfying the following
        hypotheses:
        • M is a locally κ-presentable category, and κ is sharply less than λ.
        • Kλ(M), the full subcategory of M spanned by the λ-compact objects, is
        closed under finite limits in M.
        • There are < λ morphisms between any two κ-compact objects in M.
        • I and I ′ are λ-small sets of morphisms between κ-compact objects.
        Then the weak factorisation systems cofibrantly generated by I and I ′ underlie
        a model structure on M if and only if their restrictions to Kλ(M) underlie a
        model structure on Kλ(M).
        The techniques used in the proof of the above theorem are easily generalised,
        allowing us to make sense of a remark of Dugger [2001]:
        [. . . ] for a combinatorial category the interesting part of the ho-
        motopy theory is all concentrated within some small subcategory—
        beyond suﬃciently large cardinals the homotopy theory is somehow
        “formal”.
        For illustration, we will see how to validate Dugger’s principle in the case of
        right properness and axiom SM7.
        The author’s own motivation for seeking such a result is rooted in a more
        foundational question.",
