    "description": "Pulsatile insulin output, paralleled by oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+), reflect oscillating metabolism within beta-cells in response to secretory fuels. Here we question whether oscillatory periodicity is conserved or varied from stimulation to stimulation, whether glycolysis is essential for the manifestation of an oscillatory response, and if an environment of nutrient oversupply affects oscillatory regularity. We have determined that a beta-cell oscillatory Ca(2+) pattern is independent of the type of applied secretory fuel (glucose, methyl-pyruvate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate). In addition, single cells respond with the same pattern when repeatedly stimulated, regardless of the type of stimulatory fuel. Presence of substimulatory glucose is not necessary to obtain an oscillatory responses to methyl-pyruvate or alpha-ketoisocaproate. Glucose-6-phosphate, as a measure of glycolytic flux, is not detectable under these conditions. These data suggest that multiple systems, rather than a single enzyme component, can contribute to the beta-cell oscillatory behavior. Prolonged exposure to high levels of palmitate impaired oscillatory regularity in the individual beta-cells. This supports the hypothesis that a high-fat environment might contribute to loss of regular oscillatory pattern in diabetic subjects, acting, at least in part, at the level of the single beta-cel",

    "description": "The heart is the first functioning organ in the developing embryo and the detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its formation provides insights into congenital malformations affecting its function and therefore the survival of the organism. Because many developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, it is possible to extrapolate from observations made in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms to human. This review will highlight the contributions made through studying heart development in avian embryos, particularly the chicken. The major advantage of chick embryos is their accessibility for surgical manipulations and functional interference approaches, both gain- and loss-of-function. In addition to experiments performed in ovo, the dissection of tissues for ex vivo culture, genomic or biochemical approaches, is straightforward. Furthermore, embryos can be cultured for time-lapse imaging, which enables tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and detailed analyses of tissue morphogenesis. Owing to these features, investigations in chick embryos have led to important discoveries, often complementing genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish. As well as including some historical aspects, we cover here some of the crucial advances made in understanding of early heart development using the chicken model",

    "description": "Many people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are depressed and research on people who have had a heart attack found that depression increases the chance of further heart attacks. The UPBEAT-UK team conducted research with people on general practitioner CHD registers in 33 south London practices to: examine any link between CHD, depression and worse future heart disease; and develop case\\ud\nmanagement by practice nurses for people with CHD and depression. We followed 803 people with CHD for up to 3 years, assessing them for depression, chest pain and\\ud\nworsening of heart disease, and also measured care costs. We asked patients, GPs and nurses how people with CHD and depression should be treated. From this, we developed care designed for each person called ‘personalised care’ (PC). We tested it in 41 people (while 40 people received their usual care from GPs)\\ud\nwith chest pain and depression, to assess how acceptable it is, whether or not it helps and what the costs would be. PC was acceptable to people, and those who received it reported less chest pain 6 and 12 months later. Costs were lower following PC but the difference was not statistically significant. Just under half of those with CHD had chest pain. Depression was frequent, but anxiety was more\\ud\ncommon and increased the chances of both heart attacks and death. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the links between anxiety, chest pain and heart\\ud\ndisease, and to further develop our promising findings that PC can be helpful in reducing chest pain in\\ud\ngeneral practice",

    "description": "Background: To examine for a possible relationship between osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: Published and unpublished literature from: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and clinical trial registers. Search to 22nd November 2014. Cohort, case-control, randomised and non-randomised controlled trial papers reporting the prevalence of CVD in osteoarthritis were included. Results: Fifteen studies with 32,278,744 individuals were eligible. Pooled prevalence for overall CVD pathology in people with osteoarthritis was 38.4% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 37.2% to 39.6%). Individuals with osteoarthritis were almost three times as likely to have heart failure (Relative Risk (RR): 2.80; 95% CI: 2.25 to 3.49) or ischaemic heart disease (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.69) compared to matched non-osteoarthritis cohorts. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction or stroke. There was a three-fold decrease in the risk of experiencing a transient ischaemic attack in the osteoarthritis cohort compared to the non-osteoarthritis group. Conclusions: Prevalence of CVD in patients with OA is significant. There was an observed increased risk of incident heart failure and ischaemic heart disease in people with OA compared to matched controls. However the relationship between OA and CVD is not straight-forward and there is a need to better understand the potential common pathways linking pathophysiological mechanisms",

    "description": "Background: Adenosine administered as an adjunct to reperfusion can reduce coronary no-reflow and limit myocardial infarct (MI) size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Whether adjunctive adenosine therapy can improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients is not clear and is investigated in this meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion in STEMI patients. We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results: 13 RCTs (4273 STEMI patients) were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.25–0.78], P = 0.005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow<3 postreperfusion 0.68 [95% CI 0.47–0.99], P = 0.04). There was no difference in heart failure incidence in the intravenous adenosine group but most RCTs in this subgroup were from the thrombolysis era. There was no difference in non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality in both subgroups. Conclusion: We find evidence of improved clinical outcome in terms of less heart failure in STEMI patients administered intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to reperfusion. This finding will need to be confirmed in a large adequately powered prospective RCT",

    "description": "Many conditions culminate in heart failure (HF), a multi-organ systemic syndrome with an intrinsically poor prognosis. Pharmacotherapeutic agents that correct neurohormonal dysregulation and haemodynamic instability have occupied the forefront of developments within the treatment of HF in the past. Indeed, multiple trials aimed to validate these agents in the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in a large and robust evidence-base supporting their use clinically. An established treatment paradigm now exists for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but there have been very few notable developments in recent years. HF remains a significant health concern with an increasing incidence as the population ages. We may indeed be entering the surgical era for HF treatment, but these therapies remain expensive and inaccessible to many. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents are slowly emerging, many targeting alternative therapeutic pathways, but with mixed results. Metabolic modulation and manipulation of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway have shown promise and could provide the answers to fill the therapeutic gap between medical interventions and surgery, but further definitive trials are warranted. We review the significant evidence base behind the current medical treatments for HFrEF, the physiology of metabolic impairment in HF, and discuss two promising novel agents, perhexiline and nitrite",

    "description": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become a key imaging modality in clinical cardiology practice due to its unique capabilities for non-invasive imaging of the cardiac chambers and great vessels. A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice",

One\ndevelopment was the introduction of the notion of ‘combinatorial model cat-\negories’ by Smith [1998]. These correspond to what Lurie [HTT] calls ‘present-\nable ∞-categories’ and are therefore a homotopy-theoretic generalisation of\nthe locally presentable categories of Gabriel and Ulmer [1971]. The classiﬁc-\nation of locally κ-presentable categories says that each one is equivalent to\nthe free κ-ind-completion of a κ-cocomplete small category, and Lurie proved\nthe analogous proposition for presentable ∞-categories, so it should at least\nseem plausible that every combinatorial model category is generated by a small\nmodel category in an appropriate sense.\nIndeed, the work of Beke [2000] suggests that more should be true. As\nstated in the abstract of the cited paper,\nIf a Quillen model category can be speciﬁed using a certain logical\nsyntax (intuitively, ‘is algebraic/combinatorial enough’), so that it\ncan be deﬁned in any category of sheaves, then the satisfaction of\nQuillen’s axioms over any site is a purely formal consequence of\ntheir being satisﬁed over the category of sets.\nDepartment of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge,\nCambridge, UK. E-mail address: Z.L.Low@dpmms.cam.ac.uk\n1\nThe heart of a combinatorial model category\nand similarly, we can show that the question of whether a set of generating\ncoﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations in a locally presentable category really do\ngenerate a combinatorial model category depends only on an essentially small\nfull subcategory of small objects. More precisely:\nTheorem. Let M be a locally presentable category, and let I and I ′ be sub-\nsets of mor C. Suppose κ and λ are regular cardinals satisfying the following\nhypotheses:\n• M is a locally κ-presentable category, and κ is sharply less than λ.\n• Kλ(M), the full subcategory of M spanned by the λ-compact objects, is\nclosed under finite limits in M.\n• There are < λ morphisms between any two κ-compact objects in M.\n• I and I ′ are λ-small sets of morphisms between κ-compact objects.\nThen the weak factorisation systems cofibrantly generated by I and I ′ underlie\na model structure on M if and only if their restrictions to Kλ(M) underlie a\nmodel structure on Kλ(M).\nThe techniques used in the proof of the above theorem are easily generalised,\nallowing us to make sense of a remark of Dugger [2001]:\n[. . . ] for a combinatorial category the interesting part of the ho-\nmotopy theory is all concentrated within some small subcategory—\nbeyond suﬃciently large cardinals the homotopy theory is somehow\n“formal”.\nFor illustration, we will see how to validate Dugger’s principle in the case of\nright properness and axiom SM7.\nThe author’s own motivation for seeking such a result is rooted in a more\nfoundational question.",

      "description": "Aims: To describe the characteristics and time to death of patients with breast or haematological cancer who died of heart failure (HF) after cancer therapy. Patients with an index admission for HF who died of HF-related causes (IAHF) and those with no index admission for HF who died of HF-related causes (NIAHF) were compared. Methods and results: We performed a linked data analysis of cancer registry, death registry, and hospital administration records (n = 15 987). Index HF admission must have occurred after cancer diagnosis. Of the 4894 patients who were deceased (30.6% of cohort), 734 died of HF-related causes (50.1% female) of which 279 (38.0%) had at least one IAHF (41.9% female) post-cancer diagnosis. Median age was 71 years [interquartile range (IQR) 62–78] for IAHF and 66 years (IQR 56–74) for NIAHF. There were fewer chemotherapy separations for IAHF patients (median = 4, IQR 2–9) compared with NIAHF patients (median = 6, IQR 2–12). Of the IAHF patients, 71% had died within 1 year of the index HF admission. There was no significant difference in HF-related mortality in IAHF patients compared with NIAHF (HR, 1.10, 95% CI, 0.94–1.29, P = 0.225). Conclusions: The profile of IAHF patients who died of HF-related causes after cancer treatment matched the current profile of HF in the general population (over half were aged ≥70 years). However, NIAHF were younger (62% were aged ≤69 years), female patients with breast cancer that died of HF-related causes before hospital admission for HF-related causes—a group that may have been undiagnosed or undertreated until death",

Design: Prospectively designed meta-analysis of individual patient data from patients aged 40-85 in sinus rhythm at baseline, with left ventricular ejection fraction <0.45. Participants 13 833 patients from 11 trials; median age 64; 24% women. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was all cause mortality; the major secondary outcome was admission to hospital for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat with an adjusted one stage Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Compared with placebo, β blockers were effective in reducing mortality across all ages: hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.83) for the first quarter of age distribution (median age 50); 0.71 (0.58 to 0.87) for the second quarter (median age 60); 0.65 (0.53 to 0.78) for the third quarter (median age 68); and 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92) for the fourth quarter (median age 75). There was no significant interaction when age was modelled continuously (P=0.1), and the absolute reduction in mortality was 4.3% over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (number needed to treat 23). Admission to hospital for heart failure was significantly reduced by β blockers, although this effect was attenuated at older ages (interaction P=0.05). There was no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and sex in any age group. Drug discontinuation was similar regardless of treatment allocation, age, or sex (14.4% in those give β blockers, 15.6% in those receiving placebo). Conclusion: Irrespective of age or sex, patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm should receive β blockers to reduce the risk of death and admission to hospital",

      "description": "Aims In the heart, a period of ischaemia followed by reperfusion evokes powerful cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations that can cause lethal cell injury. These signals represent attractive cardioprotective targets, but the underlying mechanisms of genesis are ill-defined. Here, we investigated the role of the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), which is known in several cell types to induce Ca2+ oscillations that initiate from acidic stores such as lysosomes, likely via two-pore channels (TPCs, TPC1 and 2). Methods and results An NAADP antagonist called Ned-K was developed by rational design based on a previously existing scaffold. Ned-K suppressed Ca2+ oscillations and dramatically protected cardiomyocytes from cell death in vitro after ischaemia and reoxygenation, preventing opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Ned-K profoundly decreased infarct size in mice in vivo. Transgenic mice lacking the endo-lysosomal TPC1 were also protected from injury. Conclusion NAADP signalling plays a major role in reperfusion-induced cell death and represents a potent pathway for protection against reperfusion injury",

      "description": "Background: Self-care is important in heart failure (HF) treatment, but patients may have difficulties and be inconsistent in its performance. Inconsistencies in self-care behaviors may mirror patterns of self-care in HF patients that are worth identifying to provide interventions tailored to patients. Objectives: The aims of this study are to identify clusters of HF patients in relation to self-care behaviors and to examine and compare the profile of each HF patient cluster considering the patient's sociodemographics, clinical variables, quality of life, and hospitalizations. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study in which we enrolled 1192 HF patients across Italy. A cluster analysis was used to identify clusters of patients based on the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale factor scores. Analysis of variance and [chi]2 test were used to examine the characteristics of each cluster. Results: Patients were 72.4 years old on average, and 58% were men. Four clusters of patients were identified: (1) high consistent adherence with high consulting behaviors, characterized by younger patients, with higher formal education and higher income, less clinically compromised, with the best physical and mental quality of life (QOL) and lowest hospitalization rates; (2) low consistent adherence with low consulting behaviors, characterized mainly by male patients, with lower formal education and lowest income, more clinically compromised, and worse mental QOL; (3) inconsistent adherence with low consulting behaviors, characterized by patients who were less likely to have a caregiver, with the longest illness duration, the highest number of prescribed medications, and the best mental QOL; (4) and inconsistent adherence with high consulting behaviors, characterized by patients who were mostly female, with lower formal education, worst cognitive impairment, worst physical and mental QOL, and higher hospitalization rates. Conclusion: The 4 clusters identified in this study and their associated characteristics could be used to tailor interventions aimed at improving self-care behaviors in HF patients",

      "description": "Let $R$ be an artin algebra and $\\mathcal{C}$ an additive subcategory of\n$\\operatorname{mod}(R)$. We construct a $t$-structure on the homotopy category\n$\\operatorname{K}^{-}(\\mathcal{C})$ whose heart $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{C}}$ is\na natural domain for higher Auslander-Reiten (AR) theory. The abelian\ncategories $\\mathcal{H}_{\\operatorname{mod}(R)}$ (which is the natural domain\nfor classical AR theory) and $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{C}}$ interact via various\nfunctors. If $\\mathcal{C}$ is functorially finite then\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{C}}$ is a quotient category of\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\operatorname{mod}(R)}$. We illustrate the theory with two\nexamples:\n  Iyama developed a higher AR theory when $\\mathcal{C}$ is a maximal\n$n$-orthogonal subcategory, see \\cite{I}. In this case we show that the simple\nobjects of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{C}}$ correspond to Iyama's higher AR\nsequences and derive his higher AR duality from the existence of a Serre\nfunctor on the derived category\n$\\operatorname{D}^b(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{C}})$.\n  The category $\\mathcal{O}$ of a complex semi-simple Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ fits into higher AR theory by considering $R$ to be the\ncoinvariant algebra of the Weyl group of $\\mathfrak{g}$.Comment: 26 pages, accepted for publication in Journal of Algebra 201",

We investigate when the natural embedding $\\mathcal{H} \\to D^b\n\\mathcal{A}$ can be extended to a triangle equivalence $D^b \\mathcal{H} \\to D^b\n\\mathcal{A}$. Our focus of study is the case where $\\mathcal{A}$ is the\ncategory of finite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional hereditary\nalgebra. In this case, we prove that such an extension exists if and only if\nthe $t$-structure is bounded and the aisle $\\mathcal{U}$ of the $t$-structure\nis closed under the Serre functor.Comment: As accepted by Advances in Mathematics; some differences in label and\n  page numbering may occur between this version and the published versio",
